Credit Risk Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to credit risk assessment. The main goal of the project is to analyze customer data and identify factors that influence the likelihood of loan default. By understanding these patterns, financial institutions can make better decisions in approving or rejecting loan applications, minimizing risks associated with lending.

Project Objectives
-Understand the Dataset: Explore the features provided in the credit risk dataset and how they correlate to loan approval or default.
-Perform EDA: Use statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover trends in the data, such as income, loan amount, employment status, and credit history, and how they influence credit decisions.
-Credit Risk Insights: Identify key variables that indicate high-risk customers to improve decision-making in the loan approval process.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on loan applicants, including:
Applicant's personal information: Gender, Age, Marital Status, Employment Type, etc.
Loan-related features: Loan amount, Payment history, Credit score, etc.
Credit Bureau Data: Information on the applicantâ€™s credit inquiries and payment records.

Key Analysis Performed
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  - Handled missing values and categorical data.
  - Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries to improve analysis accuracy.

2. Feature Exploration:
  - Analyzed features such as income, loan amounts, and employment status to understand their influence on loan default.

3. Visualization:
  - Various plots and charts were used to visualize distributions and relationships between variables.

4. Risk Assessment:
  - Explored patterns in the data to identify high-risk applicants based on historical loan repayment behavior.

5. Tools and Libraries Used
  - Python: For data processing and analysis.
  - Pandas: To handle and manipulate the dataset.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code execution and analysis.

Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors affecting credit risk. Through the analysis, we identified key indicators of potential loan defaults, which can help financial institutions optimize their lending processes. By leveraging these insights, loan approval decisions can be made more accurately, reducing financial risk.
